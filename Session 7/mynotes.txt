We have the client and the server.

Where are the programs running?

They're running inside a computer: mobile phone, tablet or any device with a code. Usually we do not have ony one program but  many. The server will be running on another
computer with more than one server running different apps.

IP address on my phone: 10.3.53.40

IP address on my computer: 212.128.253.107

To see if the server is working we use the ping command.
Each line that shows up in the terminal is a ping.
The ping 8.8.8.8 is Google's ping.
It shows the time that takes to get to California and come back.

ping time to 8.8.8.8: min/avg/max/mdev = 3.491/3.699/4.458/0.286 ms

ping time to my computer: min/avg/max/mdev = 0.030/0.051/0.061/0.012 ms

ping time to my buddy: min/avg/max/mdev = 0.056/0.059/0.062/0.007 ms

ping time to my mobile phone: min/avg/max/mdev = 2.834/64.940/203.882/37.674 ms

URLS: identifying an IP address

ping time to google: min/avg/max/mdev = 3.474/3.671/4.253/0.229 ms

ping time to github.com = min/avg/max/mdev = 29.041/29.116/29.162/0.043 ms

the web server has a port, so we have to indicate the IP address of the machine and the number 80. We need to know the port number where the server is lovated
and the IP address to connect to the server.
